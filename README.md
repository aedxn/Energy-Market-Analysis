# Energy-Market-Analysis

This project is unfinished and still in progress. I use data from OECD and Eurostat to do some explorative data analysis on the current energy crisis.

So far my work includes:

* Exploring and visualising monthly energy consumer price index for selected countries over time (Data: OECD)
* Visualisation of the gas price (Data: Eurostat)
* Visualisation of gas imports from russia of selected european countries (Data: Eurostat)
