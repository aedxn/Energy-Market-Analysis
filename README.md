# Energy-Market-Analysis

In this project I use data from OECD and Eurostat to do some explorative data analysis on the current energy crisis. I then use daily gas spot prices from the US to do a time series analysis and forecastings using an ARIMA model.

My work includes:

* Exploring and visualising monthly energy consumer price index for selected countries over time (Data: OECD)
* Visualisation of gas imports from russia of selected european countries (Data: Eurostat)

Using daily US gas prices my work includes:

* Visualising the data
* Reducing seasonality of the date by using MA, seasonal decompositions and differencing
* Plotting correlograms and applying statistical test to analyse seasonality and autocorrelation
* Fitting and finding the best order of my ARIMA model
* Using the ARIMA model to forecast gas prices
